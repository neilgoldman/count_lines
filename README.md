line_counter
============

Simple Python script to count lines of code and comments in a project.

Tested with Python 2.7.8, but should work with Python 3 as well.

Make sure to open the file and customize the file extensions and sequences to use for comments/block-comments. The project directory to scan can be set inside of the script, or passed as a commandline argument.

In some cases it may not always be 100% accurate, but lines-of-code is a crappy (but fun!) metric anyways.
